ABSTRACT = {The demand for high-data-rate and time-sensitive applications, such as 4k/8k video streaming and real-time augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and gaming, has increased significantly. Addressing the inefficiency of distributed channel access and the fairness problem between uplink and downlink flows is crucial for the development of wireless local area network (WLAN) technologies. In this study, we propose a novel transmission scheme for IEEE 802.11be networks that addresses the fairness problem and improves the system throughput. Utilizing the concept of multi-AP coordinated OFDMA introduced in the 7th-generation WLAN IEEE 802.11be, the proposed transmission scheme allows an AP to share a granted transmission opportunity (TXOP) with nearby APs. A mathematically analysis of the throughput performance of the proposed schemes was performed using a Markov chain model. The simulation results verify that the scheme effectively improves the downlink fairness and the system throughput. Combined with the advanced multiuser (MU) features of IEEE 802.11ax, such as TUA, MU cascading sequence, and MU EDCA, the proposed scheme not only enhances downlink AP transmission, but also guarantees improved control over the medium. The scheme is carefully designed to be fully compatible with conventional IEEE 802.11 protocols, and is thus potentially universal.},

    abstract={Joint transmission (JT)-based Coordinated Multipoint (CoMP) systems achieve high performance gains by allowing full coordination among multiple cells, transforming unwanted intercell interference into useful signal power. In this paper, we present an analytical model to perform adaptive modulation for a typical JT CoMP system, consisting of three transmission points, under a target bit error rate (BER) constraint. Probability density functions of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) are derived for different JT CoMP schemes, and based on them, closed-form expressions for the average spectral efficiency (ASE) are obtained when adopting continuous-rate adaptive modulation. The study of ASE is also extended for the case of discrete-rate modulations, where the performance comparison of different practical quantized modulation schemes is carried out.},

	abstract = {A channel with output Y = X + S + Z is examined, The state S sim N(0, QI) and the noise Z sim N(0, NI) are multivariate Gaussian random variables ( I is the identity matrix.). The input X in R^{n} satisfies the power constraint (l/n) sum_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}^{2} leq P . If S is unknown to both transmitter and receiver then the capacity is frac{1}{2} ln (1 + P/( N + Q)) nats per channel use. However, if the state S is known to the encoder, the capacity is shown to be C^{ast} =frac{1}{2} ln (1 + P/N) , independent of Q . This is also the capacity of a standard Gaussian channel with signal-to-noise power ratio P/N . Therefore, the state S does not affect the capacity of the channel, even though S is unknown to the receiver. It is shown that the optimal transmitter adapts its signal to the state S rather than attempting to cancel it.},

	abstract = {The "writing on dirty paper"-channel model offers an information-theoretic framework for precoding techniques for canceling arbitrary interference known at the transmitter. It indicates that lossless precoding is theoretically possible at any signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and thus dirty-paper coding may serve as a basic building block in both single-user and multiuser communication systems. We design an end-to-end coding realization of a system materializing a significant portion of the promised gains. We employ multidimensional quantization based on trellis shaping at the transmitter. Coset decoding is implemented at the receiver using "virtual bits." Combined with iterative decoding of capacity-approaching codes we achieve an improvement of 2dB over the best scalar quantization scheme. Code design is done using the EXIT chart technique.},
